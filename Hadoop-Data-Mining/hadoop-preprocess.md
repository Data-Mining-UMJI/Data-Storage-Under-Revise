## Cookbook for Data Mining with Hadoop Ecosystem


### Data Storage

* Way to combine Spark with Hadoop HDFS.
    - ***To be studied.***


### Data Preprocessing

* Basic Data Import from outer file/source into Hadoop HDFS.
    - Just do as regular file systems since HDFS has do the abstraction for us, and we only need to take the cluster as a whole FS.
    - No need to be too detailed, to be updated based on the particular situation.
* Way to Implement Data Preprocessing methods under Hadoop Ecosystems:
    - Raw Hadoop MapReduce:
        + Too low-level, difficult to handle.
    - Pig/Hive:
        + ***To be studied.***
    - Spark [Currently Suggested Method]:
        + ***To be studied.***
